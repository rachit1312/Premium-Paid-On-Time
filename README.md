# Predicting if a customer will pay the next premium on time or not
This is my first Machine Learning project. It's a data science challenge conducted by Internshala in partnership with Analytics Vidhya. In this project, the client is an Insurance company. I've been asked to build a model to predict whether the policyholder (customer) will pay the next premium on time or not. The problem statement is given as a pdf file, the train & test datasets are provided in csv format, that are required to build the model. Finally, my detailed model is present in Jupyter notebook document as ipynb file.
